The CDR Sandbox is an all-encompassing “black-box” environment created using Docker to deploy images in stable, network-enabled containers. The sandbox includes preconfigured Docker Compose YAML files for quick and easy deployment in a testing/lab scenario. For production deployments, a more comprehensive orchestration solution (eg. Kubernetes) is recommended.
